**Linear Regression**
Linear regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical and machine learning technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the target) and one or more independent variables (also called features or predictors). In Python, you can perform linear regression using various libraries, such as scikit-learn, NumPy, or TensorFlow. Here, I'll describe how to do it with scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python:

# Step 1 - Importing the Dataset
Let's use the "House Prices" dataset from the popular Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." This dataset contains various features related to residential houses and their sale prices. I have used the `train.csv`.

```{python} 

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

# Explore the dataset
data.head()
```

# Step 2: Data Pre-processing
Perform data pre-processing tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features if necessary.

```{python} 
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Handle missing values (if necessary)
data['LotFrontage'].fillna(data['LotFrontage'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Encode categorical variables (if necessary)
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['MSZoning', 'Street'])

# Scale features (if necessary)
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
data[['GrLivArea']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['GrLivArea']])
```

# Step 3: Splitting the Test and Train Sets
Split the dataset into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.

```{python} 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data[['OverallQual', 'YearBuilt', 'GrLivArea']]  # Select relevant features
y = data['SalePrice']  # Define the target variable

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

#Fitting the Linear Regression Model to the Training Set
```

# Step 4: Fitting the Linear Regression Model
Build and train the linear regression model using the training set.

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

model = LinearRegression() # Create a linear regression model

model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Fit the model to the training data
```

# Step 5: Predicting Test Results
Make predictions on the test set.

```{python}
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

# Step 6: Visualizing the Test Results
Visualize the model's performance by comparing the actual and predicted values.

```{python}
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred) # Scatter plot to visualize actual vs. predicted values

plt.xlabel("Actual Sale Prices")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Sale Prices")
plt.title("Actual Sale Prices vs. Predicted Sale Prices")
plt.show()
```

# Step 7 - Test Accuracy
To test the accuracy of the linear regression model that was built using the provided code, you can calculate common regression evaluation metrics. Two common metrics are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). You can use libraries like scikit-learn to calculate these metrics.

Here's how to test the accuracy and print the MSE and R² for your linear regression model:

```{python}
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Calculate R-squared (R²) score
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse:.2f}")
print(f"R-squared (R²) Score: {r2:.2f}")
```
